<h2>About Me</h2>
<div class="about-me">
    <pre>Hello!
    I'm Patson Dsouza, a passionate third-year computer science student. From the early days of high school,programming has been my creative playground, a world where lines of code come together to shape ideas into reality.
    
    Beyond the virtual realm, I embrace the thrill of athleticism. My journey began at the age of 9, and ever since, I've been diving into the world of sports. Today, I'm deeply engaged in badminton and dragon boating, where I strive to push my limits and discover new heights of excellence. The gym is like a second home to me; I relish the rhythm of weights and cardio as I sculpt both body and mind.
    
    In quieter moments, I find solace in the intellectual challenges of chess and the soothing intricacies of Sudoku puzzles. These pursuits remind me that life is a beautiful balance between the rapid pace of competition and the serene contemplation of strategy.
    
    I believe in the harmony between technology and physicality, the symphony of logic and athleticism. This website is a reflection of my journey; from intricate code structures to intense matches on the court, every experience shapes who I am.
    
    Join me as I blend the worlds of coding and sportsmanship, finding the artistry in both bytes and shuttlecocks, and discovering the unique rhythm that defines my life.
    
    Welcome to my digital canvas.</pre>
